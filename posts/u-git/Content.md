# 🐍 DIY Git in Python

Welcome aboard! We're going to implement Git in Python to learn more about how Git works on the inside. [DIY Git in Python](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#)

This tutorial is different from most Git internals tutorials because we're not going to talk about Git only with words but also with code! We're going to write in Python as we go.

This is not a tutorial on using Git! To follow along I advise that you have working knowledge of Git. If you're a newcomer to Git, this tutorial is probably not the best place to start your Git journey. I suggest coming back here after you've used Git a bit and you're comfortable with making commits, branching, merging, pushing and pulling.
